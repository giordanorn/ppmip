## ppmip - PPM Image Processing
ppmip (**PPM** **I**mage **P**rocessing) is a image processing software with handles .ppm files.

## Motivation
This project is totally inspired on the final project of *Introdução às Técnicas de Programação* (Introduction to Programming Techniques) course given by Professor Gustavo Girão, Professor André Mauricio and Professor Márjory Abreu at UFRN later on 2019.1 semester.

I'm currently working on it in my free time totally for fun.
